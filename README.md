There is no preloaded data so you have to add data manually. You can use the above collections for your postman usage or you can use api doc alternatively in
  `http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html#/`

  Hostname for localhost: `http://localhost:8081`  
  Hostname for production: `https://assignment-school-admin-api.herokuapp.com/`  


### How to use?

1. Simply clone this git, install and run as Spring application. 
2. By default dev profile is selected
3. Use the localhost value as your hostname (listed ABOVE). 
4. Import the postman collections and ready to use (listed ABOVE). 
5. As this is secured API, you must enter your credentials under basic auth:  
```
username: admin
password: password
```
8. Or you can simply skip the steps and go to production api docs
